# Enhancing Farmer Productivity Through Innovative Technology Solutions 🌾  
Smart India Hackathon 2025 | Team InnoSphere (SIH25168)

This project is an AI-powered digital agriculture advisory platform designed to help Indian farmers improve productivity, income, and sustainability. By leveraging real-time weather data, soil health information (AgriStack / Soil Health Cards), crop history, and live mandi prices, the platform delivers personalized recommendations for crop selection, irrigation planning, fertilizer usage, pest control, and market decisions.

The system enables farmers to securely register using Aadhaar or mobile OTP, create detailed farm profiles, and receive timely advisories through a smart dashboard and a multilingual voice/text chatbot (Krishi Sakhi). Built using Flutter and React.js for the frontend, Node.js or Django for backend services, and PostgreSQL/MongoDB for data storage, the platform integrates AI models from OpenAI or HuggingFace and is deployed on scalable cloud infrastructure.

Developed for Smart India Hackathon 2025, the solution aligns with national digital agriculture initiatives such as AgriStack, the Soil Health Card Scheme, and ISRO Bhuvan. It is designed to be scalable, inclusive, and future-ready, supporting farmers in transitioning from traditional practices to scientific, data-driven farming across rural India.
